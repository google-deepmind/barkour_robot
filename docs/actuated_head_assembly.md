# Barkour Robot Actuated Head Assembly

This document describes the assembly instructions for the actuated head.

The actuated head adds 2 degrees of freedom to the robot's neck as well as a
mouth (gripper). In this hardware variant, the Intel RealSense camera is removed
and image/depth data is instead provided by RGB and ToF sensors located in the
robot's eye sockets.

## Subassemblies

### Dynamixel Prep

#### Requirements:

**1. Dynamixel Wizard**

Dynamixel Wizard is an optimized tool for managing Dynamixel motors from various
operating systems. In order to proceed with motor ID assignment, you will need
Dynamixel Wizard installed onto your machine. You can find the downloadable
software and installation instructions on the
[Dynamixel Wizard website](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/).

**2. U2D2 Connector Assembly**

The U2D2 connector assembly is a small size USB communication converter that
enables to control and to operate the DYNAMIXEL with the PC.

![u2d2 connector assembly](images/brah_assembly/prepare_structures/u2d2_connector_assembly.png)

#### ID Assignment

1.  Run the Dynamixel Wizard

2.  In **Options > Scan**, ensure that all of the protocols, baudrates, and
    ports are enabled prior to scanning. Lower the **ID range** to make the
    scanning process faster.

![Scanning Options](images/brah_assembly/prepare_structures/u2d2_scanning_options.png)

1.  Ensure the U2D2 assembly has power and a data connection to your PC. Plug
    the U2D2's JST connector into the desired Dynamixel motor. Once the
    connection has been made, begin the **Scan**. Once the Wizard locates your
    desired Dynamixel motor, you may press **skip** to safely end the scan
    before completion. {value=3}

![Scanning for Motors](images/brah_assembly/prepare_structures/u2d2_scan_motors.png)

1.  **Connect** to the motor and locate **ID** in the item list. Change the
    motor's ID assignment to correspond with the motor's desired function:
    {value=4}

Function   | ID Assignment
---------- | -------------
Neck Pitch | ID 1
Head Yaw   | ID 2
Jaw        | ID 3

![ID Settings](images/brah_assembly/prepare_structures/u2d2_id_settings.png)

NOTE: During the motor ID assignment phase, the motors should be all be clocked
to the same orientation when looking at the absolute encoder count, such that
the programming is consistent from head unit to head unit.

NOTE: Be sure to **Save** any changes you make prior to disconnect.

1.  While you're here, now is a good opportunity to test the functionality of
    the Dynamixel motor. Enable **Torque** and mess with the dial a bit to
    ensure that the motor operates nominally. Alternatively, **Velocity** mode
    creates a smoother motion especially when testing the motors in the context
    of the head assembly. {value=5}

![Torque Testing](images/brah_assembly/prepare_structures/u2d2_torque_test.png)

1.  When you are done, disable **Torque** and **Disconnect** from the motor
    *before* unplugging it from the U2D2 assembly. Congratulations! You are now
    ready for assembly. {value=6}

    idler shim between the motor and the structure. {value=1}

![image of step 1's inserting shim between neck pitch motor and idler shim ](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_neck_step_1.jpg)

1.  Confirm alignment of the shim holes with the fastener holes on the motor.
    {value=2}

![image of step 2's aligning shim holes](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_neck_step_2.jpg)

1.  Turning the motor over to the output side, rotate the neck structure to
    align the arrow with the marked dot on the motor. {value=3}

![image of step 3's arrow to marked dot alignment](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_neck_step_3.jpg)

1.  Turn the motor back to the idler horn side to bias the neck structure
    towards the idle side. Torque down the 8x M2x4mm FHCS to 30 cNm. Torque down
    in a star pattern. {value=4}

![image of step 4's torque M2x4 FHCS](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_neck_step_4.jpg)

1.  Turn the structure over one more time and torque down the 8x M2x6mm SHCS to
    30cNm. Set aside for now. {value=5}

![image of step 5's torque M2x6 SHCS](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_neck_step_5.jpg)

1.  With pliers, bend the torsion spring to the correct configuration. This is
    estimated by the
    [drawing of TO-5188L](https://deepmind.onshape.com/documents/0ba344dda6e09547328e0696/v/92392d60ef98f2901f5156ce/e/19f8cd6aba48b1b9441f32f9)
    , however for a one-off build, the following ad hoc procedure may provide
    better results: (a) Place the spring into the mandrel. (b) Mark the location
    of the first bend with a permanent marker. (c) Make a bend using two pairs
    of pliers (regular + needle nose work well), accounting for the bend radius.
    (d) Put the spring back in the mandrel, check against the part, and repeat
    from (b) to make more bends. (e) Test the spring by running the neck through
    its full range of motion. Make any needed adjustments. {value=6}

![image of step 6's bent torsion spring](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_neck_step_6.jpg)

1.  Insert the head yaw motor (dynamixel with idler horn installed) and torque
    down the 8x M2.5x5mm to 30cNm. These screws (and other motor mount
    locations) are critical and loosening due to vibration should be prevented
    using Loctite 425 (cyanoacrylate based) to avoid interaction between the
    loctite and plastic parts. {value=9}

![image of step 9's sides of head yaw motor](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_neck_step_9a.jpg)
![image of step 9's bottom of head yaw motor](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_neck_step_9b.jpg)

1.  Install the stock 185mm Dynamixel motor cable on neck pitch motor. {value=10}

    NOTE: The original CAD indicates the spring is blocking the port. Depending
    on how the spring is bent, there may be a need to undo the spring to install
    the cable.

![image of step 10's cable insertion to neck pitch motor under spring](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_neck_step_10.png)

1.  Install one of the custom 225mm Dynamixel motor cable on other port of the
    neck pitch motor. Plug the cable to the motor before dropping the motor into

### Cosmetic Shell Subassembly

![shell subassembly exploded view](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_exploded_shells.png)

#### Parts required

Prepare the following parts:

Qty | Part No.  | Description
--- | --------- | -----------------
11  | 91502A103 | M3x0.5 x 8mm SHCS

Prepare the following tools:

Qty | Tool                | Where used | Torque?
--- | ------------------- | ---------- | -------
1   | M2.5 Hex Driver bit | Step 3     | 30 cNm

#### Instructions

1.  The head shell must be applied first. Tilting the head forward to get the
    lens holes to align first makes this step a little easier. Carefully guide
    the head shell on top of the head structure. Make sure to monitor the lens
    during application to avoid scratching the lens. The head shell should rest
    on the head structure ends. {value=1}

![image of step 1 structure to head shell mounting point](images/brah_assembly/subassemblies/subassembly_shells_step1.jpg)

1.  Torque down 2x M3x8mm on each side of the head, below the ear, to 30 cNm.
    {value=2}

1.  With the right neck shell, torque down the remaining 5x M2x8mm on the neck
    structure and opposite shell to 30 cNm. {value=5}

1.  Complete a final assembly check. Check range of motion for each joint
    individually, then compounded motions. Address any areas where cables add
    significant load to the motors. Check for counter-balance spring behavior.
    Then power the motors and run each motor to ensure the software-configured
    limits (motor parameters and virtual hard-stop) are correct.

## Camera Focusing

### Prerequisites

*   git
*   a USB port
*   basic command line knowledge

### Setup and focusing

1.  Install the Luxonis' depthai-python repo according to the
    [Luxonis instructions](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/install/).
2.  Plug the USB cable from the actuated head assembly into your computer.
3.  Run the script at `depthai-python/examples/ColorCamera/rgb_video.py` to open
    a viewer window and see the output from the camera. If your camera has been
    connected to the `CAM_B` port, you may need to open the script in a text
    editor of your choice and replace references to `CAM_A` with `CAM_B`.

```
cd depthai-python/examples/ColorCamera
python3 rgb_video.py
```

1.  Aim the head where it can see far from your desk. {value=4}
2.  Slowly adjust the lens until objects very far away are in focus.
3.  Aim the head to where it can see objects ~20-30cm away.
4.  Slowly tune the lens focus until those objects are reasonably well focused.
5.  Hold the lens in place, and gently tighten the lockring until tight.
6.  Verify focus by aiming the head further away. Repeat prior steps if needed.
